### About Me
I am a Full-stack developer with industry experience in creating user interfaces for data visualisation and writing solutions for managing and analysing data warehouse. I'm a UI/UX enthusiast and winner of the IVP UX Core 2019 Hackathon.

My strengths lies is debugging. I can debug a piece code from front-end i.e. JavaScript, HTML, CSS etc, explore possible issues and flaws in back-end i.e. C#, SQL, SQL Profiler etc. and then finally reach the event viewers for further analysis and logs.

I can adpat to new technologies and specialise in JavaScript and have professional experience working with C#, SQL Server, CSS, HTML, jQuery. I also have experience working with frameworks and libraries such as .net framework, React, KnockoutJs, highcharts.js etc.
